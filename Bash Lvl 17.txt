#Bash lesson 17From over the wire challenge BanditThe credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.In terminal:$ nmap –open -T5 -v -n -p31000-32000 127.0.0.1This will map all the open connections (nmap –open -p31000-32000) from the port 31000 to port 32000, -n to reduce time (tells nmap to never do reverse DNS resolution on the active IP addresses it finds), -T5 (timing The template names are paranoid (0), sneaky (1), polite (2),normal (3), aggressive (4), and insane (5) ). -v to verbose.The previous command will show 5 ports introduce the ports in the next command to find the password.$ openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0:”insert port here”The correct port will give us a provate key when introducing the password for this lvl (cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd).Know we make a temporal directory$ mktemp -dA route for a temp directory will appear and then we will go to that route$ cd /tmp/tmp…..Here we will make a id_rsa document with the provate key$ nano id_rsaPast the private key and save.$ chmod 600 id_rsa #to change the permission to only read write for owner$ ssh -i id_rsa bandit17@localhost #then yes to enter bandit17No password will appear you will be now in bandit17.
