#Bash lesson 24From over the wire challenge BanditA program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy around…In terminal:$   cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh$ mktemp -d$ cd #to tmp directory$ chmod o+rx ../tmp.YX5r0PkNER$ touch script.sh$ chmod +x script.sh$ nano script.sh # #!/bin/bash cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/tmp…/contra.txt$ cp script.sh /var/spool/bandit24/script.sh$ chmod o+w /tmp/tmp.$ watch -n 1 ls -l #wait till contra.txt appears it should be < 1 min.$ cat contra.txtPassword will appear.
