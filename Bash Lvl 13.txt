#Bash lesson 13From over the wire challenge BanditThe password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)In terminal: $ ls # data.txt is shown$ mkdir /tmp/prueba1234

$ cp data.txt /tmp/prueba1234

$ cd /tmp/prueba1234

$ xxd -r data.txt > data

$ file data <---  //this will show us the type of compression the file is in.

$ #if file is gzip rename to data.gz, if is bzip2 rename to data.bz2 if is a tar rename to data.tar

$ mv data data.gz #(.bz for bzip2 and .tar for tar)

$ gzip -d data.gz #(bzip2 -d data.bz for bzip2 and tar xf data.tar for tar)

$ #repeat until file data is ASCII text and do a cat to the file.Password will appear.
